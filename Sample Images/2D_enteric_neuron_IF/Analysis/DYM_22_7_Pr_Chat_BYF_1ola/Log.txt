If you are getting an error during ganglia prediction, please download a new ganglia model or check DeepImageJ version. It should be > v3
When running for the first time, it may take a while to initialize. Go to Window->Console to check progress

all ganglia conditions finished
Counting cells per ganglia. This may take some time for large images.
No. of neurons in ganglia 1009 does not equal the total neurons detected 1034.
This means that the ganglia outlines are not accurate and neurons are missing
