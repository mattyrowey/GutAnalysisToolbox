Gut Analysis Toolbox or GAT allows the semi-automated analysis of the cells within the enteric nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract in **2D**. GAT enables quantification of enteric neurons and their subtypes in **gut wholemounts**. It runs in FIJI, a popular image analysis software in microscopy and uses deep learning models to segment cells of interest. 

You can also watch tutorials for GAT on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmBt1Dumq60p4mIFT4j7TP_PVRjbO55Oi).

What you can do with GAT:
* Semi-automated analysis of number of enteric neurons: Uses pan-neuronal marker Hu or anything with similar 
 labelling
* Normalise counts to the number of ganglia.
* Count number of neuronal subtypes, such as ChAT, nNOS etc..
* Spatial analysis using number of neighboring cells.
* Calcium imaging analysis: Alignment of images and extraction of normalised traces


## Reporting problems

If you have any difficulties, suggestions or find any bugs, you can either:

* Use [this link](https://forms.gle/oEpFMtQo29Dr9AQT7) to access a Google form for submitting issues or questions.

OR

* Create a post under [Issues](https://github.com/pr4deepr/GutAnalysisToolbox/issues) 

OR

* Post the problem on the [Imagesc forum](https://forum.image.sc/) and tag @pr4deepr

## Model files for use in FIJI

The GAT models are located in `Fiji.app/models` folder and contains 3 separate model files:

- **Enteric neuron model: 2D_enteric_neuron_v4_1.zip**
  
  StarDist model to segment enteric neurons labelled with Hu, a pan-neuronal marker
- **Enteric neuron subtype model: 2D_enteric_neuron_subtype_v4_1.zip**
  
  StarDist model to segment enteric neuronal subtypes. It has been trained on images with labelling for:
  * neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)
  * Calbindin
  * Calretinin
  * Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) reporter (mCherry)
  * Delta-opioid receptor (DOR) reporter (GFP)
  * Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)
  * Neurofilament (NFM)
- **Ganglia model folder: 2D_enteric_ganglia_v2.bioimage.io.model**
  
  DeepImageJ-based UNet model to segment ganglia. Needs both Hu and a neuronal/glial marker labelling the ganglia
